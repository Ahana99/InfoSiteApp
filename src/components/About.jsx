          React Router enables "client side routing" and enables you to
          implement dynamic routing in a web app. It allows you to display pages
          and allow users to navigate them. It is a fully-featured client and
          server-side routing library for React. React Router Dom is used to
          build single-page applications i.e. applications that have many pages
          or components but the page is never refreshed instead the content is
          dynamically fetched based on the URL. This process is called Routing
          and it is made possible with the help of React Router Dom.
